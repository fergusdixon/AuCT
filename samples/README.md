# Samples for AuCT development

3 September 2017

Two sub-folders separate _m4a_ (as recorded raw) and _wav_ (converted on desktop) versions of the same recordings.
Under each format, samples are separated into:

* _quiet_ (~ 1 min recordings of a word list with common theme)
* _spliced_ (~ 2 sec recordings of individual words)
* _challenging_ (~ 1 min recordings with adverse conditions like background audio and intentional mistakes)

Sound was recorded on an iPhone 6 in the iOS voice memo application.
