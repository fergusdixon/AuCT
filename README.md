# AuCT
(Audio Capture Tool)

South Africa has eleven official languages. Building out tools to support small-scale voice recognition across a large number of languages requires having a large amount of labeled audio files for training and testing. Your task is to create a web-based, or combination web- and mobile-based tool to support the collection and in situ segmentation and labeling of audio data. The use case is: a participant would use your tool to record a set of words from a list. These would then be segmented, with some control to throw out mistakes that may have been made during data capture, resulting in a set of individual, labeled audio files.
